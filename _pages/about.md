I believe that developing solutions to agricultural problems using open-source technologies have a much higher chance of acceptance among the world's resource-poor regions. Therefore, my broader research interest leans on creating useful agriculture tools using open-source software for the farmer at no cost. Other research interests include employing applications of IoT, big data, and computer vision in agriculture, for which I have been educating and honing my coding skills in their respective areas by engaging myself in university courses and other online resources. With all these interests and skills on hand, I believe I will discover, analyze, and build beneficial and functional tools for current agricultural research problems.

Biography
======
Harsh Pathak(https://engineering.purdue.edu/ABE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=257378) is from a North Indian city known as Prayagraj. After completing his schooling, he joined Asia oldest agriculture university, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Science and Technology (SHUATS) (https://shuats.edu.in/), and completed his undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Technology in Agricultural Engineering.  As a part of his Bachelor's project, he developed a prototype for automating irrigation using microcontrollers and sensors using IoT. After graduating from SHUATS in May 2019, he joined Massey Ferguson (https://www.tafe.com/tractors/massey-ferguson/) as a field officer in the Market Development Department, where his role was to increase sales by organizing different market development activities. In August 2019, he left Massey, and in September 2019, he joined North Dakota State University to pursue his master's degree in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (https://www.ndsu.edu/aben/) under the mentorship of Dr. Igathinathane Cannayen (https://www.ndsu.edu/aben/faculty_staff/dr_igathinathane_cannayen/). Pathak worked in Dr. Cannayen's research group at North Greater Plains Research Laboratory (NGPRL), USDA, Mandan. During his stay at NGPRL, he developed computer vision algorithms using open-source software to analyze UAV imagery for different agricultural applications. In August 2021, he graduated from North Dakota State University and joined Purdue University to complete his doctoral degree in Agricultural and Biological Engineering (https://engineering.purdue.edu/ABE) under the mentorship of Dr. Dennis Buckmaster (https://engineering.purdue.edu/ABE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=42205).
