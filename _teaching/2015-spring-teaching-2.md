As a teaching assistant for Dr. Dennis Buckmaster, I was responsible for conducting half of the course's laboratory sessions and managing associated grading responsibilities. This hands-on experience allowed me to work directly with students and reinforce concepts covered in lectures. For the final module focused on Python programming, I took full ownership of the curriculum development and instruction. This included designing comprehensive theoretical content, creating practical laboratory exercises, and evaluating student performance. To enhance students' conceptual understanding and analytical thinking skills, I incorporated case study-based assignments that connected programming principles to real-world agricultural applications. A standout assignment challenged students to develop Python scripts that would help farmers determine When is the right time to irrigate corn based on theoretical concepts covered in class.
