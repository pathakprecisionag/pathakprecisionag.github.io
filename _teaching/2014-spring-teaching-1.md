As a teaching assistant for Dr. Dennis Buckmaster, I provided comprehensive support throughout the course, leading lab sessions and managing grading responsibilities. For the final Python module, I took a leadership role by designing and implementing the complete curriculum, including both theoretical content and practical laboratory exercises. To enhance students' conceptual understanding and develop their analytical thinking skills, I incorporated case study-based assignments that connected programming concepts to real-world agricultural applications. One particularly effective assignment challenged students to create Python scripts that would help farmers determine optimal corn planting times based on theoretical principles covered in lectures.
